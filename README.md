# EverQuest Planes of Power Flag Tracker Bot

A Discord bot designed to track progress through EverQuest's Planes of Power expansion. Players can track flag completion, share progress with guildmates, and see which flags they are eligible to complete next.

Built using [Deno](https://deno.land/) and Typescript. Utilizes [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for storage of Player Flags. Supabase is a powerful managed Postgres solution with a generous free tier. The project includes a Database (DB) Type abstraction so that any storage can be used. If no desire to use Supabase then remove references to Supabase and implement another DB type.

The Bot is designed for a PER Server usage, there is no interaction across servers.
